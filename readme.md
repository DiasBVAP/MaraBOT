# MaraBOT

This bot's sole purpose is mentioning someone when they get online on Discord.

## Installation

Just clone the repo and run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.

## Setup

In *.env*, add your bot's token, the id of the channel that you want the mentions to be sent on,
and the Discord id (minus the tag. Ex: John#9999 -> John) of the user you want to be mentioned.

## Usage

Start the script by running *start.bat*. If you want to run the bot on startup, just add an shortcut to *start.bat* to your windows startup folder.
